      "['<s>  chapter i. down the rabbit hole  alice was beginning to get very tired of sitting by her sister on the bank, and of having nothing to do  once or twice she had peeped into the book her sister was reading, but it had no pictures or conversations in it, and what is the use of a book, thought alice without pictures or conversations? </s>', '<s> so she was considering in her own mind (as well as she could, for the hot day made her feel very sleepy and stupid), whether the pleasure of making a daisy chain would be worth the trouble of getting up and picking the daisies, when suddenly a white rabbit with pink eyes ran close by her. </s>', '<s> there was nothing so very remarkable in that  nor did alice think it so very much out of the way to hear the rabbit say to itself, oh dear! </s>', '<s> oh dear! </s>', '<s> i shall be late! </s>', '<s> (when she thought it over afterwards, it occurred to her that she ought to have wondered at this, but at the time it all seemed quite natural)  but when the rabbit actually took a watch out of its waistcoat pocket, and looked at it, and then hurried on, alice started to her feet, for it flashed across her mind that she had never before seen a rabbit with either a waistcoat pocket, or a watch to take out of it, and burning with curiosity, she ran across the field after it, and fortunately was just in time to see it pop down a large rabbit hole under the hedge. </s>', '<s> in another moment down went alice after it, never once considering how in the world she was to get out again. </s>', '<s> the rabbit hole went straight on like a tunnel for some way, and then dipped suddenly down, so suddenly that alice had not a moment to think about stopping herself before she found herself falling down a very deep well. </s>', '<s> either the well was very deep, or she fell very slowly, for she had plenty of time as she went down to look about her and to wonder what was going to happen next. </s>', '<s> first, she tried to look down and make out what she was coming to, but it was too dark to see anything  then she looked at the sides of the well, and noticed that they were filled with cupboards and book shelves  here and there she saw maps and pictures hung upon pegs. </s>', '<s> she took down a jar from one of the shelves as she passed  it was labelled orange marmalade, but to her great disappointment it was empty  she did not like to drop the jar for fear of killing somebody, so managed to put it into one of the cupboards as she fell past it. </s>', '<s> thought alice to herself, after such a fall as this, i shall think nothing of tumbling down stairs! </s>', '<s> how brave theyll all think me at home! </s>', '<s> why, i wouldnt say anything about it, even if i fell off the top of the house! </s>', '<s> (which was very likely true.) </s>', '<s> down, down, down. </s>', '<s> would the fall never come to an end! </s>', '<s> i wonder how many miles ive fallen by this time? </s>', '<s> she said aloud. </s>', '<s> i must be getting somewhere near the centre of the earth. </s>', '<s> let me see  that would be four thousand miles down, i think   (for, you see, alice had learnt several things of this sort in her lessons in the schoolroom, and though this was not a very good opportunity for showing off her knowledge, as there was no one to listen to her, still it was good practice to say it over)   yes, thats about the right distance  but then i wonder what latitude or longitude ive got to? </s>', '<s> (alice had no idea what latitude was, or longitude either, but thought they were nice grand words to say.) </s>', '<s> presently she began again. </s>', '<s> i wonder if i shall fall right through the earth! </s>', '<s> how funny itll seem to come out among the people that walk with their heads downward! </s>', '<s> the antipathies, i think   (she was rather glad there was no one listening, this time, as it didnt sound at all the right word)   but i shall have to ask them what the name of the country is, you know. </s>', '<s> please, maam, is this new zealand or australia? </s>', '<s> (and she tried to curtsey as she spoke  fancy curtseying as youre falling through the air! </s>', '<s> do you think you could manage it?) </s>', '<s> and what an ignorant little girl shell think me for asking! </s>', '<s> no, itll never do to ask  perhaps i shall see it written up somewhere. </s>', '<s> down, down, down. </s>', '<s> there was nothing else to do, so alice soon began talking again. </s>', '<s> dinahll miss me very much to night, i should think! </s>', '<s> (dinah was the cat.) </s>', '<s> i hope theyll remember her saucer of milk at tea time. </s>', '<s> dinah my dear! </s>', '<s> i wish you were down here with me! </s>', '<s> there are no mice in the air, im afraid, but you might catch a bat, and thats very like a mouse, you know. </s>', '<s> but do cats eat bats, i wonder? </s>', '<s> and here alice began to get rather sleepy, and went on saying to herself, in a dreamy sort of way, do cats eat bats? </s>', '<s> do cats eat bats? </s>', '<s> and sometimes, do bats eat cats? </s>', '<s> for, you see, as she couldnt answer either question, it didnt much matter which way she put it. </s>', '<s> she felt that she was dozing off, and had just begun to dream that she was walking hand in hand with dinah, and saying to her very earnestly, now, dinah, tell me the truth  did you ever eat a bat? </s>', '<s> when suddenly, thump! </s>', '<s> down she came upon a heap of sticks and dry leaves, and the fall was over. </s>', '<s> alice was not a bit hurt, and she jumped up on to her feet in a moment  she looked up, but it was all dark overhead  before her was another long passage, and the white rabbit was still in sight, hurrying down it. </s>', '<s> there was not a moment to be lost  away went alice like the wind, and was just in time to hear it say, as it turned a corner, oh my ears and whiskers, how late its getting! </s>', '<s> she was close behind it when she turned the corner, but the rabbit was no longer to be seen  she found herself in a long, low hall, which was lit up by a row of lamps hanging from the roof. </s>', '<s> there were doors all round the hall, but they were all locked  and when alice had been all the way down one side and up the other, trying every door, she walked sadly down the middle, wondering how she was ever to get out again. </s>', '<s> suddenly she came upon a little three legged table, all made of solid glass  there was nothing on it except a tiny golden key, and alices first thought was that it might belong to one of the doors of the hall  but, alas! </s>', '<s> either the locks were too large, or the key was too small, but at any rate it would not open any of them. </s>', '<s> however, on the second time round, she came upon a low curtain she had not noticed before, and behind it was a little door about fifteen inches high  she tried the little golden key in the lock, and to her great delight it fitted! </s>', '<s> alice opened the door and found that it led into a small passage, not much larger than a rat hole  she knelt down and looked along the passage into the loveliest garden you ever saw. </s>', '<s> how she longed to get out of that dark hall, and wander about among those beds of bright flowers and those cool fountains, but she could not even get her head through the doorway  and even if my head would go through, thought poor alice, it would be of very little use without my shoulders. </s>', '<s> oh, how i wish i could shut up like a telescope! </s>', '<s> i think i could, if i only knew how to begin. </s>', '<s> for, you see, so many out of the way things had happened lately, that alice had begun to think that very few things indeed were really impossible. </s>', '<s> there seemed to be no use in waiting by the little door, so she went back to the table, half hoping she might find another key on it, or at any rate a book of rules for shutting people up like telescopes  this time she found a little bottle on it, (which certainly was not here before, said alice,) and round the neck of the bottle was a paper label, with the words drink me beautifully printed on it in large letters. </s>', '<s> it was all very well to say drink me, but the wise little alice was not going to do that in a hurry. </s>', '<s> no, ill look first, she said, and see whether its marked poison or not  for she had read several nice little histories about children who had got burnt, and eaten up by wild beasts and other unpleasant things, all because they would not remember the simple rules their friends had taught them  such as, that a red hot poker will burn you if you hold it too long  and that if you cut your finger very deeply with a knife, it usually bleeds  and she had never forgotten that, if you drink much from a bottle marked poison, it is almost certain to disagree with you, sooner or later. </s>', '<s> however, this bottle was not marked poison, so alice ventured to taste it, and finding it very nice, (it had, in fact, a sort of mixed flavour of cherry tart, custard, pine apple, roast turkey, toffee, and hot buttered toast,) she very soon finished it off. </s>', '<s> *    *    *    *    *    *    *      *    *    *    *    *    *    *    *    *    *    *    *    *  what a curious feeling! </s>', '<s> said alice  i must be shutting up like a telescope. </s>', '<s> and so it was indeed  she was now only ten inches high, and her face brightened up at the thought that she was now the right size for going through the little door into that lovely garden. </s>', '<s> first, however, she waited for a few minutes to see if she was going to shrink any further  she felt a little nervous about this  for it might end, you know, said alice to herself, in my going out altogether, like a candle. </s>', '<s> i wonder what i should be like then? </s>', '<s> and she tried to fancy what the flame of a candle is like after the candle is blown out, for she could not remember ever having seen such a thing. </s>', '<s> after a while, finding that nothing more happened, she decided on going into the garden at once  but, alas for poor alice! </s>', '<s> when she got to the door, she found she had forgotten the little golden key, and when she went back to the table for it, she found she could not possibly reach it  she could see it quite plainly through the glass, and she tried her best to climb up one of the legs of the table, but it was too slippery  and when she had tired herself out with trying, the poor little thing sat down and cried. </s>', '<s> come, theres no use in crying like that! </s>', '<s> said alice to herself, rather sharply  i advise you to leave off this minute! </s>', '<s> she generally gave herself very good advice, (though she very seldom followed it), and sometimes she scolded herself so severely as to bring tears into her eyes  and once she remembered trying to box her own ears for having cheated herself in a game of croquet she was playing against herself, for this curious child was very fond of pretending to be two people. </s>', '<s> but its no use now, thought poor alice, to pretend to be two people! </s>', '<s> why, theres hardly enough of me left to make one respectable person! </s>', '<s> soon her eye fell on a little glass box that was lying under the table  she opened it, and found in it a very small cake, on which the words eat me were beautifully marked in currants. </s>', '<s> well, ill eat it, said alice, and if it makes me grow larger, i can reach the key  and if it makes me grow smaller, i can creep under the door  so either way ill get into the garden, and i dont care which happens! </s>', '<s> she ate a little bit, and said anxiously to herself, which way? </s>', '<s> which way?, holding her hand on the top of her head to feel which way it was growing, and she was quite surprised to find that she remained the same size  to be sure, this generally happens when one eats cake, but alice had got so much into the way of expecting nothing but out of the way things to happen, that it seemed quite dull and stupid for life to go on in the common way. </s>', '<s> so she set to work, and very soon finished off the cake. </s>', '<s> *    *    *    *    *    *    *      *    *    *    *    *    *    *    *    *    *    *    *    *     chapter ii. </s>', '<s> the pool of tears  curiouser and curiouser! </s>', '<s> cried alice (she was so much surprised, that for the moment she quite forgot how to speak good english)  now im opening out like the largest telescope that ever was! </s>', '<s> good bye, feet! </s>', '<s> (for when she looked down at her feet, they seemed to be almost out of sight, they were getting so far off). </s>', '<s> oh, my poor little feet, i wonder who will put on your shoes and stockings for you now, dears? </s>', '<s> im sure _i_ shant be able! </s>', '<s> i shall be a great deal too far off to trouble myself about you  you must manage the best way you can   but i must be kind to them, thought alice, or perhaps they wont walk the way i want to go! </s>', '<s> let me see  ill give them a new pair of boots every christmas. </s>', '<s> and she went on planning to herself how she would manage it. </s>', '<s> they must go by the carrier, she thought  and how funny itll seem, sending presents to ones own feet! </s>', '<s> and how odd the directions will look! </s>', '<s> alices right foot, esq. </s>', '<s> hearthrug,          near the fender,            (with alices love). </s>', '<s> oh dear, what nonsense im talking! </s>', '<s> just then her head struck against the roof of the hall  in fact she was now more than nine feet high, and she at once took up the little golden key and hurried off to the garden door. </s>', '<s> poor alice! </s>', '<s> it was as much as she could do, lying down on one side, to look through into the garden with one eye  but to get through was more hopeless than ever  she sat down and began to cry again. </s>', '<s> you ought to be ashamed of yourself, said alice, a great girl like you, (she might well say this), to go on crying in this way! </s>', '<s> stop this moment, i tell you! </s>', '<s> but she went on all the same, shedding gallons of tears, until there was a large pool all round her, about four inches deep and reaching half down the hall. </s>', '<s> after a time she heard a little pattering of feet in the distance, and she hastily dried her eyes to see what was coming. </s>', '<s> it was the white rabbit returning, splendidly dressed, with a pair of white kid gloves in one hand and a large fan in the other  he came trotting along in a great hurry, muttering to himself as he came, oh! </s>', '<s> the duchess, the duchess! </s>', '<s> wont she be savage if ive kept her waiting! </s>', '<s> alice felt so desperate that she was ready to ask help of any one  so, when the rabbit came near her, she began, in a low, timid voice, if you please, sir   the rabbit started violently, dropped the white kid gloves and the fan, and skurried away into the darkness as hard as he could go. </s>', '<s> alice took up the fan and gloves, and, as the hall was very hot, she kept fanning herself all the time she went on talking  dear, dear! </s>', '<s> how queer everything is to day! </s>', '<s> and yesterday things went on just as usual. </s>', '<s> i wonder if ive been changed in the night? </s>', '<s> let me think  was i the same when i got up this morning? </s>', '<s> i almost think i can remember feeling a little different. </s>', '<s> but if im not the same, the next question is, who in the world am i? </s>', '<s> ah, thats the great puzzle! </s>', '<s> and she began thinking over all the children she knew that were of the same age as herself, to see if she could have been changed for any of them. </s>', '<s> im sure im not ada, she said, for her hair goes in such long ringlets, and mine doesnt go in ringlets at all  and im sure i cant be mabel, for i know all sorts of things, and she, oh! </s>', '<s> she knows such a very little! </s>', '<s> besides, shes she, and im i, and  oh dear, how puzzling it all is! </s>', '<s> ill try if i know all the things i used to know. </s>', '<s> let me see  four times five is twelve, and four times six is thirteen, and four times seven is  oh dear! </s>', '<s> i shall never get to twenty at that rate! </s>', '<s> however, the multiplication table doesnt signify  lets try geography. </s>', '<s> london is the capital of paris, and paris is the capital of rome, and rome  no, thats all wrong, im certain! </s>', '<s> i must have been changed for mabel! </s>', '<s> ill try and say how doth the little   and she crossed her hands on her lap as if she were saying lessons, and began to repeat it, but her voice sounded hoarse and strange, and the words did not come the same as they used to do          how doth the little crocodile       improve his shining tail,      and pour the waters of the nile       on every golden scale! </s>', '<s> how cheerfully he seems to grin,       how neatly spread his claws,      and welcome little fishes in       with gently smiling jaws! </s>', '<s> im sure those are not the right words, said poor alice, and her eyes filled with tears again as she went on, i must be mabel after all, and i shall have to go and live in that poky little house, and have next to no toys to play with, and oh! </s>', '<s> ever so many lessons to learn! </s>', '<s> no, ive made up my mind about it  if im mabel, ill stay down here! </s>', '<s> itll be no use their putting their heads down and saying come up again, dear! </s>', '<s> i shall only look up and say who am i then? </s>', '<s> tell me that first, and then, if i like being that person, ill come up  if not, ill stay down here till im somebody else  but, oh dear! </s>', '<s> cried alice, with a sudden burst of tears, i do wish they would put their heads down! </s>', '<s> i am so very tired of being all alone here! </s>', '<s> as she said this she looked down at her hands, and was surprised to see that she had put on one of the rabbits little white kid gloves while she was talking. </s>', '<s> how can i have done that? </s>', '<s> she thought. </s>', '<s> i must be growing small again. </s>', '<s> she got up and went to the table to measure herself by it, and found that, as nearly as she could guess, she was now about two feet high, and was going on shrinking rapidly  she soon found out that the cause of this was the fan she was holding, and she dropped it hastily, just in time to avoid shrinking away altogether. </s>', '<s> that was a narrow escape! </s>', '<s> said alice, a good deal frightened at the sudden change, but very glad to find herself still in existence  and now for the garden! </s>', '<s> and she ran with all speed back to the little door  but, alas! </s>', '<s> the little door was shut again, and the little golden key was lying on the glass table as before, and things are worse than ever, thought the poor child, for i never was so small as this before, never! </s>', '<s> and i declare its too bad, that it is! </s>', '<s> as she said these words her foot slipped, and in another moment, splash! </s>', '<s> she was up to her chin in salt water. </s>', '<s> her first idea was that she had somehow fallen into the sea, and in that case i can go back by railway, she said to herself. </s>', '<s> (alice had been to the seaside once in her life, and had come to the general conclusion, that wherever you go to on the english coast you find a number of bathing machines in the sea, some children digging in the sand with wooden spades, then a row of lodging houses, and behind them a railway station.) </s>', '<s> however, she soon made out that she was in the pool of tears which she had wept when she was nine feet high. </s>', '<s> i wish i hadnt cried so much! </s>', '<s> said alice, as she swam about, trying to find her way out. </s>', '<s> i shall be punished for it now, i suppose, by being drowned in my own tears! </s>', '<s> that will be a queer thing, to be sure! </s>', '<s> however, everything is queer to day. </s>', '<s> just then she heard something splashing about in the pool a little way off, and she swam nearer to make out what it was  at first she thought it must be a walrus or hippopotamus, but then she remembered how small she was now, and she soon made out that it was only a mouse that had slipped in like herself. </s>', '<s> would it be of any use, now, thought alice, to speak to this mouse? </s>', '<s> everything is so out of the way down here, that i should think very likely it can talk  at any rate, theres no harm in trying. </s>', '<s> so she began  o mouse, do you know the way out of this pool? </s>', '<s> i am very tired of swimming about here, o mouse! </s>', '<s> (alice thought this must be the right way of speaking to a mouse  she had never done such a thing before, but she remembered having seen in her brothers latin grammar, a mouse  of a mouse  to a mouse  a mouse  o mouse!) </s>', '<s> the mouse looked at her rather inquisitively, and seemed to her to wink with one of its little eyes, but it said nothing. </s>', '<s> perhaps it doesnt understand english, thought alice  i daresay its a french mouse, come over with william the conqueror. </s>', '<s> (for, with all her knowledge of history, alice had no very clear notion how long ago anything had happened.) </s>', '<s> so she began again  ou est ma chatte? </s>', '<s> which was the first sentence in her french lesson book. </s>', '<s> the mouse gave a sudden leap out of the water, and seemed to quiver all over with fright. </s>', '<s> oh, i beg your pardon! </s>', '<s> cried alice hastily, afraid that she had hurt the poor animals feelings. </s>', '<s> i quite forgot you didnt like cats. </s>', '<s> not like cats! </s>', '<s> cried the mouse, in a shrill, passionate voice. </s>', '<s> would you like cats if you were me? </s>', '<s> well, perhaps not, said alice in a soothing tone  dont be angry about it. </s>', '<s> and yet i wish i could show you our cat dinah  i think youd take a fancy to cats if you could only see her. </s>', '<s> she is such a dear quiet thing, alice went on, half to herself, as she swam lazily about in the pool, and she sits purring so nicely by the fire, licking her paws and washing her face  and she is such a nice soft thing to nurse  and shes such a capital one for catching mice  oh, i beg your pardon! </s>', '<s> cried alice again, for this time the mouse was bristling all over, and she felt certain it must be really offended. </s>', '<s> we wont talk about her any more if youd rather not. </s>', '<s> we indeed! </s>', '<s> cried the mouse, who was trembling down to the end of his tail. </s>', '<s> as if i would talk on such a subject! </s>', '<s> our family always hated cats  nasty, low, vulgar things! </s>', '<s> dont let me hear the name again! </s>', '<s> i wont indeed! </s>', '<s> said alice, in a great hurry to change the subject of conversation. </s>', '<s> are you  are you fond  of  of dogs? </s>', '<s> the mouse did not answer, so alice went on eagerly  there is such a nice little dog near our house i should like to show you! </s>', '<s> a little bright eyed terrier, you know, with oh, such long curly brown hair! </s>', '<s> and itll fetch things when you throw them, and itll sit up and beg for its dinner, and all sorts of things  i cant remember half of them  and it belongs to a farmer, you know, and he says its so useful, its worth a hundred pounds! </s>', '<s> he says it kills all the rats and  oh dear! </s>', '<s> cried alice in a sorrowful tone, im afraid ive offended it again! </s>', '<s> for the mouse was swimming away from her as hard as it could go, and making quite a commotion in the pool as it went. </s>', '<s> so she called softly after it, mouse dear! </s>', '<s> do come back again, and we wont talk about cats or dogs either, if you dont like them! </s>', '<s> when the mouse heard this, it turned round and swam slowly back to her  its face was quite pale (with passion, alice thought), and it said in a low trembling voice, let us get to the shore, and then ill tell you my history, and youll understand why it is i hate cats and dogs. </s>', '<s> it was high time to go, for the pool was getting quite crowded with the birds and animals that had fallen into it  there were a duck and a dodo, a lory and an eaglet, and several other curious creatures. </s>', '<s> alice led the way, and the whole party swam to the shore. </s>', '<s> chapter iii. </s>', '<s> a caucus race and a long tale  they were indeed a queer looking party that assembled on the bank  the birds with draggled feathers, the animals with their fur clinging close to them, and all dripping wet, cross, and uncomfortable. </s>', '<s> the first question of course was, how to get dry again  they had a consultation about this, and after a few minutes it seemed quite natural to alice to find herself talking familiarly with them, as if she had known them all her life. </s>', '<s> indeed, she had quite a long argument with the lory, who at last turned sulky, and would only say, i am older than you, and must know better  and this alice would not allow without knowing how old it was, and, as the lory positively refused to tell its age, there was no more to be said. </s>', '<s> at last the mouse, who seemed to be a person of authority among them, called out, sit down, all of you, and listen to me! </s>', '<s> ill soon make you dry enough! </s>', '<s> they all sat down at once, in a large ring, with the mouse in the middle. </s>', '<s> alice kept her eyes anxiously fixed on it, for she felt sure she would catch a bad cold if she did not get dry very soon. </s>', '<s> said the mouse with an important air, are you all ready? </s>', '<s> this is the driest thing i know. </s>', '<s> silence all round, if you please!

</s>', '<s> i wouldnt be in bills place for a good deal  this fireplace is narrow, to be sure  but i think i can kick a little! </s>', '<s> she drew her foot as far down the chimney as she could, and waited till she heard a little animal (she couldnt guess of what sort it was) scratching and scrambling about in the chimney close above her  then, saying to herself this is bill, she gave one sharp kick, and waited to see what would happen next. </s>', '<s> the first thing she heard was a general chorus of there goes bill!

</s>', '<s> the poor little thing sobbed again (or grunted, it was impossible to say which), and they went on for some while in silence. </s>', '<s> alice was just beginning to think to herself, now, what am i to do with this creature when i get it home? </s>', '<s> when it grunted again, so violently, that she looked down into its face in some alarm. </s>', '<s> this time there could be no mistake about it  it was neither more nor less than a pig, and she felt that it would be quite absurd for her to carry it further. </s>', '<s> so she set the little creature down, and felt quite relieved to see it trot away quietly into the wood. </s>', '<s> if it had grown up, she said to herself, it would have made a dreadfully ugly child  but it makes rather a handsome pig, i think. </s>', '<s> and she began thinking over other children she knew, who might do very well as pigs, and was just saying to herself, if one only knew the right way to change them   when she was a little startled by seeing the cheshire cat sitting on a bough of a tree a few yards off. </s>', '<s> the cat only grinned when it saw alice. </s>', '<s> it looked good natured, she thought  still it had very long claws and a great many teeth, so she felt that it ought to be treated with respect. </s>', '<s> cheshire puss, she began, rather timidly, as she did not at all know whether it would like the name  however, it only grinned a little wider. </s>', '<s> come, its pleased so far, thought alice, and she went on. </s>', '<s> would you tell me, please, which way i ought to go from here? </s>', '<s> that depends a good deal on where you want to get to, said the cat. </s>', '<s> i dont much care where   said alice. </s>', '<s> then it doesnt matter which way you go, said the cat. </s>', '<s> so long as i get somewhere, alice added as an explanation. </s>', '<s> oh, youre sure to do that, said the cat, if you only walk long enough. </s>', '<s> alice felt that this could not be denied, so she tried another question. </s>', '<s> what sort of people live about here? </s>', '<s> in that direction, the cat said, waving its right paw round, lives a hatter  and in that direction, waving the other paw, lives a march hare. </s>', '<s> visit either you like  theyre both mad. </s>', '<s> but i dont want to go among mad people, alice remarked. </s>', '<s> oh, you cant help that, said the cat  were all mad here. </s>', '<s> im mad. </s>', '<s> youre mad. </s>', '<s> how do you know im mad? </s>', '<s> said alice. </s>', '<s> you must be, said the cat, or you wouldnt have come here. </s>', '<s> alice didnt think that proved it at all  however, she went on and how do you know that youre mad? </s>', '<s> to begin with, said the cat, a dogs not mad. </s>', '<s> you grant that? </s>', '<s> i suppose so, said alice. </s>', '<s> well, then, the cat went on, you see, a dog growls when its angry, and wags its tail when its pleased. </s>', '<s> now i growl when im pleased, and wag my tail when im angry. </s>', '<s> therefore im mad. </s>', '<s> i call it purring, not growling, said alice. </s>', '<s> call it what you like, said the cat. </s>', '<s> do you play croquet with the queen to day? </s>', '<s> i should like it very much, said alice, but i havent been invited yet. </s>', '<s> youll see me there, said the cat, and vanished. </s>', '<s> alice was not much surprised at this, she was getting so used to queer things happening. </s>', '<s> while she was looking at the place where it had been, it suddenly appeared again. </s>', '<s> by the bye, what became of the baby? </s>', '<s> said the cat. </s>', '<s> id nearly forgotten to ask. </s>', '<s> it turned into a pig, alice quietly said, just as if it had come back in a natural way. </s>', '<s> i thought it would, said the cat, and vanished again. </s>', '<s> alice waited a little, half expecting to see it again, but it did not appear, and after a minute or two she walked on in the direction in which the march hare was said to live. </s>', '<s> ive seen hatters before, she said to herself  the march hare will be much the most interesting, and perhaps as this is may it wont be raving mad  at least not so mad as it was in march. </s>', '<s> as she said this, she looked up, and there was the cat again, sitting on a branch of a tree. </s>', '<s> did you say pig, or fig? </s>', '<s> said the cat. </s>', '<s> i said pig, replied alice  and i wish you wouldnt keep appearing and vanishing so suddenly  you make one quite giddy. </s>', '<s> all right, said the cat  and this time it vanished quite slowly, beginning with the end of the tail, and ending with the grin, which remained some time after the rest of it had gone. </s>', '<s> ive often seen a cat without a grin, thought alice  but a grin without a cat!

</s>', '<s> and who are these? </s>', '<s> said the queen, pointing to the three gardeners who were lying round the rosetree  for, you see, as they were lying on their faces, and the pattern on their backs was the same as the rest of the pack, she could not tell whether they were gardeners, or soldiers, or courtiers, or three of her own children. </s>', '<s> how should i know? </s>', '<s> said alice, surprised at her own courage. </s>', '<s> its no business of mine. </s>', '<s> the queen turned crimson with fury, and, after glaring at her for a moment like a wild beast, screamed off with her head! </s>', '<s> off    nonsense! </s>', '<s> said alice, very loudly and decidedly, and the queen was silent. </s>', '<s> the king laid his hand upon her arm, and timidly said consider, my dear  she is only a child!

</s>', '<s> roared the queen, and alice joined the procession, wondering very much what would happen next. </s>', '<s> its  its a very fine day! </s>', '<s> said a timid voice at her side. </s>', '<s> she was walking by the white rabbit, who was peeping anxiously into her face. </s>', '<s> very, said alice    wheres the duchess? </s>', '<s> said the rabbit in a low, hurried tone. </s>', '<s> he looked anxiously over his shoulder as he spoke, and then raised himself upon tiptoe, put his mouth close to her ear, and whispered shes under sentence of execution. </s>', '<s> what for? </s>', '<s> said alice. </s>', '<s> did you say what a pity!? </s>', '<s> the rabbit asked. </s>', '<s> no, i didnt, said alice  i dont think its at all a pity. </s>', '<s> i said what for? </s>', '<s> she boxed the queens ears   the rabbit began. </s>', '<s> alice gave a little scream of laughter. </s>', '<s> oh, hush! </s>', '<s> the rabbit whispered in a frightened tone. </s>', '<s> the queen will hear you! </s>', '<s> you see, she came rather late, and the queen said    get to your places! </s>', '<s> shouted the queen in a voice of thunder, and people began running about in all directions, tumbling up against each other  however, they got settled down in a minute or two, and the game began. </s>', '<s> alice thought she had never seen such a curious croquet ground in her life  it was all ridges and furrows  the balls were live hedgehogs, the mallets live flamingoes, and the soldiers had to double themselves up and to stand on their hands and feet, to make the arches. </s>', '<s> the chief difficulty alice found at first was in managing her flamingo  she succeeded in getting its body tucked away, comfortably enough, under her arm, with its legs hanging down, but generally, just as she had got its neck nicely straightened out, and was going to give the hedgehog a blow with its head, it would twist itself round and look up in her face, with such a puzzled expression that she could not help bursting out laughing  and when she had got its head down, and was going to begin again, it was very provoking to find that the hedgehog had unrolled itself, and was in the act of crawling away  besides all this, there was generally a ridge or furrow in the way wherever she wanted to send the hedgehog to, and, as the doubled up soldiers were always getting up and walking off to other parts of the ground, alice soon came to the conclusion that it was a very difficult game indeed. </s>', '<s> the players all played at once without waiting for turns, quarrelling all the while, and fighting for the hedgehogs  and in a very short time the queen was in a furious passion, and went stamping about, and shouting off with his head! </s>', '<s> or off with her head! </s>', '<s> about once in a minute. </s>', '<s> alice began to feel very uneasy  to be sure, she had not as yet had any dispute with the queen, but she knew that it might happen any minute, and then, thought she, what would become of me? </s>', '<s> theyre dreadfully fond of beheading people here  the great wonder is, that theres any one left alive! </s>', '<s> she was looking about for some way of escape, and wondering whether she could get away without being seen, when she noticed a curious appearance in the air  it puzzled her very much at first, but, after watching it a minute or two, she made it out to be a grin, and she said to herself its the cheshire cat  now i shall have somebody to talk to. </s>', '<s> how are you getting on? </s>', '<s> said the cat, as soon as there was mouth enough for it to speak with. </s>', '<s> alice waited till the eyes appeared, and then nodded. </s>', '<s> its no use speaking to it, she thought, till its ears have come, or at least one of them. </s>', '<s> in another minute the whole head appeared, and then alice put down her flamingo, and began an account of the game, feeling very glad she had someone to listen to her. </s>', '<s> the cat seemed to think that there was enough of it now in sight, and no more of it appeared. </s>', '<s> i dont think they play at all fairly, alice began, in rather a complaining tone, and they all quarrel so dreadfully one cant hear oneself speak  and they dont seem to have any rules in particular  at least, if there are, nobody attends to them  and youve no idea how confusing it is all the things being alive  for instance, theres the arch ive got to go through next walking about at the other end of the ground  and i should have croqueted the queens hedgehog just now, only it ran away when it saw mine coming! </s>', '<s> how do you like the queen? </s>', '<s> said the cat in a low voice. </s>', '<s> not at all, said alice  shes so extremely   just then she noticed that the queen was close behind her, listening  so she went on,   likely to win, that its hardly worth while finishing the game. </s>', '<s> the queen smiled and passed on. </s>', '<s> who are you talking to? </s>', '<s> said the king, going up to alice, and looking at the cats head with great curiosity. </s>', '<s> its a friend of mine  a cheshire cat, said alice  allow me to introduce it. </s>', '<s> i dont like the look of it at all, said the king  however, it may kiss my hand if it likes. </s>', '<s> id rather not, the cat remarked. </s>', '<s> dont be impertinent, said the king, and dont look at me like that! </s>', '<s> he got behind alice as he spoke. </s>', '<s> a cat may look at a king, said alice. </s>', '<s> ive read that in some book, but i dont remember where. </s>', '<s> well, it must be removed, said the king very decidedly, and he called the queen, who was passing at the moment, my dear! </s>', '<s> i wish you would have this cat removed! </s>', '<s> the queen had only one way of settling all difficulties, great or small. </s>', '<s> off with his head! </s>', '<s> she said, without even looking round. </s>', '<s> ill fetch the executioner myself, said the king eagerly, and he hurried off. </s>', '<s> alice thought she might as well go back, and see how the game was going on, as she heard the queens voice in the distance, screaming with passion. </s>', '<s> she had already heard her sentence three of the players to be executed for having missed their turns, and she did not like the look of things at all, as the game was in such confusion that she never knew whether it was her turn or not. </s>', '<s> so she went in search of her hedgehog. </s>', '<s> the hedgehog was engaged in a fight with another hedgehog, which seemed to alice an excellent opportunity for croqueting one of them with the other  the only difficulty was, that her flamingo was gone across to the other side of the garden, where alice could see it trying in a helpless sort of way to fly up into a tree. </s>', '<s> by the time she had caught the flamingo and brought it back, the fight was over, and both the hedgehogs were out of sight  but it doesnt matter much, thought alice, as all the arches are gone from this side of the ground. </s>', '<s> so she tucked it away under her arm, that it might not escape again, and went back for a little more conversation with her friend. </s>', '<s> when she got back to the cheshire cat, she was surprised to find quite a large crowd collected round it  there was a dispute going on between the executioner, the king, and the queen, who were all talking at once, while all the rest were quite silent, and looked very uncomfortable. </s>', '<s> the moment alice appeared, she was appealed to by all three to settle the question, and they repeated their arguments to her, though, as they all spoke at once, she found it very hard indeed to make out exactly what they said. </s>', '<s> the executioners argument was, that you couldnt cut off a head unless there was a body to cut it off from  that he had never had to do such a thing before, and he wasnt going to begin at his time of life. </s>', '<s> the kings argument was, that anything that had a head could be beheaded, and that you werent to talk nonsense. </s>', '<s> the queens argument was, that if something wasnt done about it in less than no time shed have everybody executed, all round. </s>', '<s> (it was this last remark that had made the whole party look so grave and anxious.) </s>', '<s> alice could think of nothing else to say but it belongs to the duchess  youd better ask her about it. </s>', '<s> shes in prison, the queen said to the executioner  fetch her here. </s>', '<s> and the executioner went off like an arrow. </s>', '<s> the cats head began fading away the moment he was gone, and, by the time he had come back with the duchess, it had entirely disappeared  so the king and the executioner ran wildly up and down looking for it, while the rest of the party went back to the game. </s>', '<s> chapter ix. </s>', '<s> the mock turtles story  you cant think how glad i am to see you again, you dear old thing! </s>', '<s> said the duchess, as she tucked her arm affectionately into alices, and they walked off together. </s>', '<s> alice was very glad to find her in such a pleasant temper, and thought to herself that perhaps it was only the pepper that had made her so savage when they met in the kitchen. </s>', '<s> when im a duchess, she said to herself, (not in a very hopeful tone though), i wont have any pepper in my kitchen at all. </s>', '<s> soup does very well without  maybe its always pepper that makes people hot tempered, she went on, very much pleased at having found out a new kind of rule, and vinegar that makes them sour  and camomile that makes them bitter  and  and barley sugar and such things that make children sweet tempered. </s>', '<s> i only wish people knew that  then they wouldnt be so stingy about it, you know    she had quite forgotten the duchess by this time, and was a little startled when she heard her voice close to her ear. </s>', '<s> youre thinking about something, my dear, and that makes you forget to talk. </s>', '<s> i cant tell you just now what the moral of that is, but i shall remember it in a bit. </s>', '<s> perhaps it hasnt one, alice ventured to remark. </s>', '<s> tut, tut, child! </s>', '<s> said the duchess. </s>', '<s> everythings got a moral, if only you can find it. </s>', '<s> and she squeezed herself up closer to alices side as she spoke. </s>', '<s> alice did not much like keeping so close to her  first, because the duchess was very ugly  and secondly, because she was exactly the right height to rest her chin upon alices shoulder, and it was an uncomfortably sharp chin. </s>', '<s> however, she did not like to be rude, so she bore it as well as she could. </s>', '<s> the games going on rather better now, she said, by way of keeping up the conversation a little. </s>', '<s> tis so, said the duchess  and the moral of that is  oh, tis love, tis love, that makes the world go round! </s>', '<s> somebody said, alice whispered, that its done by everybody minding their own business! </s>', '<s> ah, well! </s>', '<s> it means much the same thing, said the duchess, digging her sharp little chin into alices shoulder as she added, and the moral of that is  take care of the sense, and the sounds will take care of themselves. </s>', '<s> how fond she is of finding morals in things! </s>', '<s> alice thought to herself. </s>', '<s> i dare say youre wondering why i dont put my arm round your waist, the duchess said after a pause  the reason is, that im doubtful about the temper of your flamingo. </s>', '<s> shall i try the experiment? </s>', '<s> he might bite, alice cautiously replied, not feeling at all anxious to have the experiment tried. </s>', '<s> very true, said the duchess  flamingoes and mustard both bite. </s>', '<s> and the moral of that is  birds of a feather flock together. </s>', '<s> only mustard isnt a bird, alice remarked. </s>', '<s> right, as usual, said the duchess  what a clear way you have of putting things! </s>', '<s> its a mineral, i think, said alice. </s>', '<s> of course it is, said the duchess, who seemed ready to agree to everything that alice said  theres a large mustard mine near here. </s>', '<s> and the moral of that is  the more there is of mine, the less there is of yours. </s>', '<s> oh, i know! </s>', '<s> exclaimed alice, who had not attended to this last remark, its a vegetable. </s>', '<s> it doesnt look like one, but it is. </s>', '<s> i quite agree with you, said the duchess  and the moral of that is  be what you would seem to be  or if youd like it put more simply  never imagine yourself not to be otherwise than what it might appear to others that what you were or might have been was not otherwise than what you had been would have appeared to them to be otherwise. </s>', '<s> i think i should understand that better, alice said very politely, if i had it written down  but i cant quite follow it as you say it. </s>', '<s> thats nothing to what i could say if i chose, the duchess replied, in a pleased tone. </s>', '<s> pray dont trouble yourself to say it any longer than that, said alice. </s>', '<s> oh, dont talk about trouble! </s>', '<s> said the duchess. </s>', '<s> i make you a present of everything ive said as yet. </s>', '<s> a cheap sort of present! </s>', '<s> thought alice. </s>', '<s> im glad they dont give birthday presents like that! </s>', '<s> but she did not venture to say it out loud. </s>', '<s> thinking again? </s>', '<s> the duchess asked, with another dig of her sharp little chin. </s>', '<s> ive a right to think, said alice sharply, for she was beginning to feel a little worried. </s>', '<s> just about as much right, said the duchess, as pigs have to fly  and the m    but here, to alices great surprise, the duchesss voice died away, even in the middle of her favourite word moral, and the arm that was linked into hers began to tremble. </s>', '<s> alice looked up, and there stood the queen in front of them, with her arms folded, frowning like a thunderstorm. </s>', '<s> a fine day, your majesty!

</s>', '<s> alice watched the white rabbit as he fumbled over the list, feeling very curious to see what the next witness would be like,   for they havent got much evidence yet, she said to herself. </s>', '<s> imagine her surprise, when the white rabbit read out, at the top of his shrill little voice, the name alice! </s>', '<s> chapter xii. </s>', '<s> alices evidence   here! </s>', '<s> cried alice, quite forgetting in the flurry of the moment how large she had grown in the last few minutes, and she jumped up in such a hurry that she tipped over the jury box with the edge of her skirt, upsetting all the jurymen on to the heads of the crowd below, and there they lay sprawling about, reminding her very much of a globe of goldfish she had accidentally upset the week before. </s>', '<s> oh, i beg your pardon! </s>', '<s> she exclaimed in a tone of great dismay, and began picking them up again as quickly as she could, for the accident of the goldfish kept running in her head, and she had a vague sort of idea that they must be collected at once and put back into the jury box, or they would die. </s>', '<s> the trial cannot proceed, said the king in a very grave voice, until all the jurymen are back in their proper places  all, he repeated with great emphasis, looking hard at alice as he said do. </s>', '<s> alice looked at the jury box, and saw that, in her haste, she had put the lizard in head downwards, and the poor little thing was waving its tail about in a melancholy way, being quite unable to move. </s>', '<s> she soon got it out again, and put it right  not that it signifies much, she said to herself  i should think it would be quite as much use in the trial one way up as the other. </s>', '<s> as soon as the jury had a little recovered from the shock of being upset, and their slates and pencils had been found and handed back to them, they set to work very diligently to write out a history of the accident, all except the lizard, who seemed too much overcome to do anything but sit with its mouth open, gazing up into the roof of the court. </s>', '<s> what do you know about this business? </s>', '<s> the king said to alice. </s>', '<s> nothing, said alice. </s>', '<s> nothing whatever? </s>', '<s> persisted the king. </s>', '<s> nothing whatever, said alice. </s>', '<s> thats very important, the king said, turning to the jury. </s>', '<s> they were just beginning to write this down on their slates, when the white rabbit interrupted  unimportant, your majesty means, of course, he said in a very respectful tone, but frowning and making faces at him as he spoke. </s>', '<s> unimportant, of course, i meant, the king hastily said, and went on to himself in an undertone,  important  unimportant  unimportant  important   as if he were trying which word sounded best. </s>', '<s> some of the jury wrote it down important, and some unimportant. </s>', '<s> alice could see this, as she was near enough to look over their slates  but it doesnt matter a bit, she thought to herself. </s>', '<s> at this moment the king, who had been for some time busily writing in his note book, cackled out silence! </s>', '<s> and read out from his book, rule forty two. </s>', '<s> all persons more than a mile high to leave the court. </s>', '<s> everybody looked at alice. </s>', '<s> im not a mile high, said alice. </s>', '<s> you are, said the king. </s>', '<s> nearly two miles high, added the queen. </s>', '<s> well, i shant go, at any rate, said alice  besides, thats not a regular rule  you invented it just now. </s>', '<s> its the oldest rule in the book, said the king. </s>', '<s> then it ought to be number one, said alice. </s>', '<s> the king turned pale, and shut his note book hastily. </s>', '<s> consider your verdict, he said to the jury, in a low, trembling voice. </s>', '<s> theres more evidence to come yet, please your majesty, said the white rabbit, jumping up in a great hurry  this paper has just been picked up. </s>', '<s> whats in it? </s>', '<s> said the queen. </s>', '<s> i havent opened it yet, said the white rabbit, but it seems to be a letter, written by the prisoner to  to somebody. </s>', '<s> it must have been that, said the king, unless it was written to nobody, which isnt usual, you know. </s>', '<s> who is it directed to? </s>', '<s> said one of the jurymen. </s>', '<s> it isnt directed at all, said the white rabbit  in fact, theres nothing written on the outside. </s>', '<s> he unfolded the paper as he spoke, and added it isnt a letter, after all  its a set of verses. </s>', '<s> are they in the prisoners handwriting? </s>', '<s> asked another of the jurymen. </s>', '<s> no, theyre not, said the white rabbit, and thats the queerest thing about it. </s>', '<s> (the jury all looked puzzled.) </s>', '<s> he must have imitated somebody elses hand, said the king. </s>', '<s> (the jury all brightened up again.) </s>', '<s> please your majesty, said the knave, i didnt write it, and they cant prove i did  theres no name signed at the end. </s>', '<s> if you didnt sign it, said the king, that only makes the matter worse. </s>', '<s> you must have meant some mischief, or else youd have signed your name like an honest man. </s>', '<s> there was a general clapping of hands at this  it was the first really clever thing the king had said that day. </s>', '<s> that proves his guilt, said the queen. </s>', '<s> it proves nothing of the sort! </s>', '<s> said alice. </s>', '<s> why, you dont even know what theyre about! </s>', '<s> read them, said the king. </s>', '<s> the white rabbit put on his spectacles. </s>', '<s> where shall i begin, please your majesty? </s>', '<s> he asked. </s>', '<s> begin at the beginning, the king said gravely, and go on till you come to the end  then stop. </s>', '<s> these were the verses the white rabbit read        they told me you had been to her,     and mentioned me to him     she gave me a good character,     but said i could not swim. </s>', '<s> he sent them word i had not gone     (we know it to be true)     if she should push the matter on,     what would become of you? </s>', '<s> i gave her one, they gave him two,     you gave us three or more     they all returned from him to you,     though they were mine before. </s>', '<s> if i or she should chance to be     involved in this affair,    he trusts to you to set them free,     exactly as we were. </s>', '<s> my notion was that you had been     (before she had this fit)    an obstacle that came between     him, and ourselves, and it. </s>', '<s> dont let him know she liked them best,     for this must ever be    a secret, kept from all the rest,     between yourself and me. </s>', '<s> thats the most important piece of evidence weve heard yet, said the king, rubbing his hands  so now let the jury    if any one of them can explain it, said alice, (she had grown so large in the last few minutes that she wasnt a bit afraid of interrupting him,) ill give him sixpence. </s>', '<s> _i_ dont believe theres an atom of meaning in it. </s>', '<s> the jury all wrote down on their slates, she doesnt believe theres an atom of meaning in it, but none of them attempted to explain the paper. </s>', '<s> if theres no meaning in it, said the king, that saves a world of trouble, you know, as we neednt try to find any. </s>', '<s> and yet i dont know, he went on, spreading out the verses on his knee, and looking at them with one eye  i seem to see some meaning in them, after all. </s>', '<s> said i could not swim   you cant swim, can you? </s>', '<s> he added, turning to the knave. </s>', '<s> the knave shook his head sadly. </s>', '<s> do i look like it? </s>', '<s> he said. </s>', '<s> (which he certainly did not, being made entirely of cardboard.) </s>', '<s> all right, so far, said the king, and he went on muttering over the verses to himself  we know it to be true   thats the jury, of course  i gave her one, they gave him two   why, that must be what he did with the tarts, you know    but, it goes on they all returned from him to you, said alice. </s>', '<s> why, there they are! </s>', '<s> said the king triumphantly, pointing to the tarts on the table. </s>', '<s> nothing can be clearer than that. </s>', '<s> then again  before she had this fit   you never had fits, my dear, i think? </s>', '<s> he said to the queen. </s>', '<s> said the queen furiously, throwing an inkstand at the lizard as she spoke. </s>', '<s> (the unfortunate little bill had left off writing on his slate with one finger, as he found it made no mark  but he now hastily began again, using the ink, that was trickling down his face, as long as it lasted.) </s>', '<s> then the words dont fit you, said the king, looking round the court with a smile. </s>', '<s> there was a dead silence. </s>', '<s> its a pun! </s>', '<s> the king added in an offended tone, and everybody laughed, let the jury consider their verdict, the king said, for about the twentieth time that day. </s>', '<s> no, no! </s>', '<s> said the queen. </s>', '<s> sentence first  verdict afterwards. </s>', '<s> stuff and nonsense! </s>', '<s> said alice loudly. </s>', '<s> the idea of having the sentence first! </s>', '<s> hold your tongue! </s>', '<s> said the queen, turning purple. </s>', '<s> i wont! </s>', '<s> said alice. </s>', '<s> off with her head! </s>', '<s> the queen shouted at the top of her voice. </s>', '<s> nobody moved. </s>', '<s> who cares for you? </s>', '<s> said alice, (she had grown to her full size by this time.) </s>', '<s> youre nothing but a pack of cards! </s>', '<s> at this the whole pack rose up into the air, and came flying down upon her  she gave a little scream, half of fright and half of anger, and tried to beat them off, and found herself lying on the bank, with her head in the lap of her sister, who was gently brushing away some dead leaves that had fluttered down from the trees upon her face. </s>', '<s> wake up, alice dear! </s>', '<s> said her sister  why, what a long sleep youve had! </s>', '<s> oh, ive had such a curious dream! </s>', '<s> said alice, and she told her sister, as well as she could remember them, all these strange adventures of hers that you have just been reading about  and when she had finished, her sister kissed her, and said, it was a curious dream, dear, certainly  but now run in to your tea  its getting late. </s>', '<s> so alice got up and ran off, thinking while she ran, as well she might, what a wonderful dream it had been. </s>', '<s> but her sister sat still just as she left her, leaning her head on her hand, watching the setting sun, and thinking of little alice and all her wonderful adventures, till she too began dreaming after a fashion, and this was her dream     first, she dreamed of little alice herself, and once again the tiny hands were clasped upon her knee, and the bright eager eyes were looking up into hers  she could hear the very tones of her voice, and see that queer little toss of her head to keep back the wandering hair that would always get into her eyes  and still as she listened, or seemed to listen, the whole place around her became alive with the strange creatures of her little sisters dream. </s>', '<s> the long grass rustled at her feet as the white rabbit hurried by  the frightened mouse splashed his way through the neighbouring pool  she could hear the rattle of the teacups as the march hare and his friends shared their never ending meal, and the shrill voice of the queen ordering off her unfortunate guests to execution  once more the pig baby was sneezing on the duchesss knee, while plates and dishes crashed around it  once more the shriek of the gryphon, the squeaking of the lizards slate pencil, and the choking of the suppressed guinea pigs, filled the air, mixed up with the distant sobs of the miserable mock turtle. </s>', '<s> so she sat on, with closed eyes, and half believed herself in wonderland, though she knew she had but to open them again, and all would change to dull reality  the grass would be only rustling in the wind, and the pool rippling to the waving of the reeds  the rattling teacups would change to tinkling sheep bells, and the queens shrill cries to the voice of the shepherd boy  and the sneeze of the baby, the shriek of the gryphon, and all the other queer noises, would change (she knew) to the confused clamour of the busy farm yard  while the lowing of the cattle in the distance would take the place of the mock turtles heavy sobs. </s>', '<s> lastly, she pictured to herself how this same little sister of hers would, in the after time, be herself a grown woman  and how she would keep, through all her riper years, the simple and loving heart of her childhood  and how she would gather about her other little children, and make their eyes bright and eager with many a strange tale, perhaps even with the dream of wonderland of long ago  and how she would feel with all their simple sorrows, and find a pleasure in all their simple joys, remembering her own child life, and the happy summer days. </s>', '<s> the end        </s>']\n"
